> "To a person with a hammer, everything looks like a nail." - Charlie Munger

Every now and then, you come across a book that strikes you as utter genious, and make you wish that you had seen this book earlier. To me, one such books is "**Poor Charlie's Almanack**".

## My Review

"**Poor Charlie's Almanack**" is a collection of speeches and writings by Charlie Munger, the business partner of Warren Buffett. Munger is known for his wit, wisdom, and unique approach to investing and life. The book is Munger's rendition to the inspiring "**Poor Richard's Almanack**".

While Charlie is comparatively lesser known to the famed Warren Buffett, his wisdom had been enormously influential in the success and philosophy of Bershire Hathaway.

While the book covers a wide range of topics, including investing, psychology, decision-making, and personal development, and while many of its talks and ideas are well worth revisiting and restudying, the biggest take away, and perhaps the most important one is the importance of the concept of <span class="highlight-text">**Worldly Wisdom**</span>.

Worldly wisdom, at its barebone, is a multidisciplinary approach to problem-solving. Munger emphasizes the value of learning from various disciplines, such as psychology, economics, and history, to make better decisions in life and business.

To accompany the worldly wisdom, which conceptually is brutally simplistic, but practially is a nightmare to exercise, the book also emphasizes mental models. He encourages readers to develop a toolkit of mental models that can be applied to different situations, drawing from the key principles of various disciplines. The models are said to be organized in the form of checklists, where each situation should go through all models, before beign fully understood. These mental models help in understanding complex problems and making better decisions.


### My attempt at forming the checklist
While Charlie spoke about the importance of using checklists to improve decision making, particularly in investing and business contexts, he did not provided a specific, detailed checklist in the same way that, for example, a pilot might use before a flight.

Following the lattice model, I will attempt to list out the various key disciplines to consider, and the key principles of each discipline. Note that this will likely be a work in process for many years to come, as slowly grasp the essense of various domains.

While this may be a dawnting checklist of items due to its sheer size, with repetition, I believe many of these should become second nature. Plus, what good investment or life decision was ever made without a little bit of hard work?

Ironically, another famous investor also has a list of principles. But compared to Ray Dalio's principles that actually bloomed into a full scale book, and are criticized by many as a mere collection of Ray's spontaenous, and often self contradicting brainwaves, my list should be much more manageable... More on Ray some other time...

#### Math
- [ ] basic arithmetic

    Does the numbers work out correctly?
- [ ] compounding (interest)
    Don't underestimate recurring effects. On a long term compounding makes huge differences. For ex. taxes.
- [ ] combinations and permutations
    Decision tree theory heavily applies C&P, one should carefully do so when making any important decisions.
    My understanding of the implication of this principle is fairly limited.
- [ ] probability
- [ ] statistics
    Understanding the distribution of data (normal, bell shaped), and the implications of the data

#### Physics
- [ ] critical mass
    The minimum amount of a substance needed to sustain a chain reaction. This can be applied to other areas of life, such as business and personal development.
- [ ] inertia
    An object in motion stays in motion, an object at rest stays at rest. This can be applied to habits and decision-making.

#### Engineering
- [ ] quality control
    Ensuring that the product is of high quality. This borrows from Math, probability and statistics. Costs so much, but expected to save so much.
- [ ] redundancy & backup systems
    Ensuring that the product is reliable, even if some parts fail. This is a key principle in engineering, and can be applied to other areas of life as well.
- [ ] breakpoints
    Understanding the limits of a system, and what happens when those limits are reached. Borrows from critical mass theory in physics.

#### Biology
- [ ] evolution
    Understanding how species evolve over time, and how this can be applied to business and personal development

#### Accounting
- [ ] double-entry bookkeeping
    Every transaction has two sides, one debit and one credit
- [ ] conservatism
    When uncertain, recognize expenses and liabilities as soon as possible, and revenes and assets when they are assured of being received
- [ ] depreciation & amortization
    Recognize the decrease in value of assets over time
- [ ] substance over form
    Focus on the economic reality of a transaction, rather than its legal form
- [ ] limitations of accounting
    Accounting is a tool, not a perfect representation of reality

#### Economics
- [ ] Advantages of scale
    The cost advantages of producing in large quantities. Ex. Experience curve, where you get better quicker as you have more experience; Social proof (psychology) where more poeple doing something (scale) makes it more likely for others to do it.
- [ ] Disadvantages of scale
    The cost disadvantages of producing in large quantities. Ex. Diseconomies of scale, where as you grow, you become less efficient. Narrower specialization provides more efficiency, compared to a large scale operation with generalization. 
    More importanlty, beurocracy, red tape, corruption increase with scale, and can be a huge disadvantage.
- [ ] supply and demand
    The relationship between the availability of a product and the desire for that product. Beware of the engrained effects on price.
- [ ] competitive advantage
    The unique advantage that a company has over its competitors. This can be due to a variety of factors, such as cost, quality, or brand recognition.
- [ ] opportunity cost
    The cost of choosing one option over another.
- [ ] cost-benefit analysis
    Weighing the costs and benefits of anything, be it decisions, investments, or projects.
- [ ] discriminating between when technology will help you and when it will kill you
    Where will the benefits of technology go to? Your business? Your upstream? Your downstream?
- [ ] competitive destruction
    When technology advances so fast, the early bird advantage is so huge that existing business disrupted by this technology cannot catch up, and later entrants with similar technology can't catch the "surfing wave"

#### Business
- [ ] growth stock model: untapped pricing power
    Disney had untapped pricing power, Coca-Cola did as well. Finding these + high conviction == finidng money in the street
    Is NVIDIA also untapped pricing power? No, that's natural supply and demand. Apple on the other hand, might be so.
- [ ] constantly on top of technology
    Gillette's ability to constantly stay near the edge of technology improvement in their field.
- [ ] cancer surgery business
    GEICO had a lot of bad businesses, all they had to do was cut out all the folly and go back to the perfectly wonderful buisness that was lying there.
#### Psychology
The brain/perceptual apparatus has shortcuts, as the brain cannot have unlimited circuitry, and these shortcuts are often exploited by marketers, politicians, and others. Understanding these shortcuts can help one make better decisions.
- [ ] misjudgment
    Understanding the common errors in judgement that humans make, and how to avoid them. Munger lists about 24 of these in his various speeches.
    1. reward and punishment superresponse tendency
        Overreacting to incentives.
    2. liking/loving tendency
        Favoring those we like or love.

        Being influenced by mere associations, either good or bad.
    11. simple, pain-avoiding psychological denial
        Denying the reality of painful situations.
    12. excessive self-regard tendency
        Overrating our own qualities and abilities.
    13. over-optimism tendency
        Being overly optimistic about favorable outcomes.
    14. deprival-superreaction tendency
        Overreacting to being deprived of something previously owned or almost gained.
    15. social-proof tendency
        Following the lead of others, especially in social or uncertain situations.
    16. contrast-misreaction tendency
        Judgments influenced by contrasts, not absolute values, often leading to irrational decisions.
    17. stress-influence tendency

- [ ] Pavlovian association
    Unconditioned stimulus (food) leads to unconditioned response (salivation). Conditioned stimulus (bell) leads to conditioned response (salivation). This can be applied to marketing and other areas of life.
- [ ] 5Ws
    Knowing what, where, when, who, why will allow one to understand the task and the importance of it better, making it easier to succeed. Psychologists use the 5Ws to gather detailed patient histories to tailor their therapeutic approaches effectively. We can use the 5Ws to understand the task and its importance better, making it easier to succeed.
- [ ] cognitive biases
    Humans are not rational, and are prone to making systematic errors in judgement
- [ ] incentives
    Understanding what motivates people to act in a certain way, and how to use this to your advantage. Great examples are Federal Express, where the employees were incentivized to deliver packages on time, and the company was able to deliver packages faster than its competitors.

### Wordly Wisdom in action --- A case study using <b>The Rise of AI</b>
Any company can use genAI, can train genAI, just like any company can use electricity. But the companies that will succeed are the ones that can use genAI to create a competitive advantage. This is where the concept of Worldly Wisdom comes in.


Overall, "Poor Charlie's Almanack" is a must-read for anyone interested in investing, business, and personal development. Munger's wisdom and insights provide valuable lessons that can be applied to various aspects of life. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced investor, this book offers a wealth of knowledge and inspiration.

I highly recommend "Poor Charlie's Almanack" to anyone looking to expand their understanding of investing and gain valuable insights from one of the greatest minds in the field.


## The "Best" Talks
There are in total eleven talks in the book. Naturally I find some of them more memorable, interesting and impactful at this current stage, well knowing that as I grow older and wiser, this ranking may change.
Here are the talks and the overview, ranked in importance. Perhaps one day I'll dive deeper into a few of these talks.
- Talk One: Harvard School Commencement Speech
    - As the only graduation speech Charlie ever gave, he used the inverse methodology borrowed from algebraist Jacobi, and shared seven qualities that led to a miserable life
        - Ingesting chemicals to alter mood or perception
        - Envy
        - Resentment
        - Being unreliable
        - Learn everything from personal experience
        - Go down and stay down
        - Minimize objectivity
- Talk two: A leasson on Elementary, Worldly Wisdom as It Relates to Investment Management and Buisiness
    - Here for the first time, we read about Charlie's definition of worldly wisdom. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the big ideas from various fields, such as maths, accounting, biology, psychology, economics, etc. Collectively, key concepts/models borrowed from these different disciplines form the Wordly Wisdom. 
    - He also applies this concept to stock picking!
- Talk three: A leasson on Elementary, Worldly Wisdom as It Relates to Investment Management and Buisiness Revisited
    - Naturally this talk should be read in tandum with Talk two. The talk dives deeper into the latticework of mental models, provies more examples to deepen the understanding. This talk focused on the virtues of patience and discipline in investment.

## My favorite quotes from the book

> "Take a simple idea and take it seriously."

> "Invert, always invert."

> "Tell me where I'm going to die, that is, so I don't go there."

> "Develop into a lifelong self-learner through voracious reading; cultivate curiosity and strive to become a little wiser every day."

> "Life will have terrible blows in it, horrible blows, unfair blows. It doesn't matter. And some people recover and others don't. And there I think the attitude of Epictetus is the best. He thought that every missed chance in life was an opportunity to behave well, every missed chance in life was an opportunity to learn something, and that your duty was not to be submerged in self-pity, but to utilize the terrible blow in constructive fashion. That is a very good idea."

> "Every person is going to have a circle of competence. And it's going to be very hard to advance that circle. If I had to make my living as a musician, I can't even think of a level low enough to describe where I would be sorted out to if music were the measuring standard of the civilization. So you have to figure out what your own aptitudes are. If you play games where other people have the aptitudes and you don't, you're going to lose. And that's as close to certain as any prediction that you can make. You have to figure out where you've got an edge. And you've got to play within your own circle of competence."

> "It's not given to human beings to have such talent that they can just know everything about everything all the time. But it is given to human beings who work hard at it—who look and sift the world for a mispriced bet—that they can occasionally find one. And the wise ones bet heavily when the world offers them that opportunity. They bet big when they have the odds. And the rest of the time, they don't. It's just that simple...
How many insights do you need? Well, I'd argue: that you don't need many in a lifetime. If you look at Berkshire Hathaway and all of its accumulated billions, the top ten insights account for most of it...
So you can get very remarkable investment results if you think more like a winning pari-mutuel player. Just think of it as a heavy odds against game full of craziness with an occasional mispriced something or other. And you're probably not going to be smart enough to find thousands in a lifetime. And when you get a few, you really load up. It's just that simple. That is a very simple concept. And to me it's obviously right—based on experience not only from the pari-mutuel machines, but everywhere else."

> "I could improve your ultimate financial welfare by giving you a ticket with only twenty slots in it so that you had twenty punches—representing all the investments that you got to make in a lifetime. And once you'd punched through the card, you couldn't make any more investments at all. Under those rules, you'd really think carefully about what you did, and you'd be forced to load up on what you'd really thought about. So you'd do so much better."

> "In investment management today, everybody wants not only to win, but to have the path never diverge very much from a standard path except on the upside. Well, that's a very artificial, crazy construct. That is really hobbling yourself."

> "Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Step by step you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. But you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts. Slug it out one inch at a time, day by day. At the end of the day—if you live long enough—most people get what they deserve."

And in the famed fashion, with that, I have nothing to add.
